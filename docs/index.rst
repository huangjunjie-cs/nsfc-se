nsfc-latex-se documentation
===========================

This project is based on my experiences on nsfc.
Writing NSFC has become one of the most important activities for scientific researchers every year.

I found this \ `fylimas/nsfc <https://github.com/fylimas/nsfc>`_ and use the template for my NSFC, which is good for the formating.
Of course, I have done some enhancement for my tastes.
